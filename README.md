# HERA: Health Empowering Resilience Assistance

HERA is a smartwatch Personalized Assistant designed to address pressing maternal health issues in India. With features focused on health monitoring, safety, fitness, and nutrition, HERA aims to empower expectant and new mothers with the support they need.

## Problem Statement

The issue of maternal health in India is critical, with approximately 800 Indian women dying from preventable causes every day, equating to a maternal death almost every two minutes. Lack of prompt access to healthcare during labor and post-labor complications, such as obesity, further exacerbate the problem.

## Product Idea

HERA: Health Empowering Resilience Assistance proposes a solution to these challenges by offering:

- Periodic monitoring of maternal health and prediction of labour.
- Alerting loved ones and enabling quick access to medical care.
- Personalized fitness and nutrition plans for pre and post-pregnancy care.
